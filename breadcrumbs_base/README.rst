eCommerce Friendly Breadcrumbs
------------------------------
This module adds friendly multi-level breadcrumbs for your website but just providing a template to be called from any template.

    **Warning!**

    This module don't have templates for front-end part of website.

    For correct front-end functionality you need to install additional module **'breadcrumbs_base_tmp'**.

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Breadcrumbs generator is available to call in any template:

::

    <t t-call="breadcrumbs_base.breadcrumbs_bar"/>

Foreach template that contain it, then a breadcrumb will be created and activate by default.

    **Warning!**

    If you call it from any portal templates you have to install **'breadcrumbs_base_tmp'** module and
    disable **'Disable My Account Breadcrumbs Bar'** view on web editor.
    Otherwise you will have two breadcrumbs at the same time, this and portal default breadcrumbs.

Style
_____
Add a shadow with border bottom and transition when scrolling to differentiate the body content of the breadcrumbs bar

Portal
~~~~~~
Include always a reference for My portal Home and not to loose that reference when you navigate into your documents.

Also include a Home link integrated with My Portal Home link.

Settings
~~~~~~~~

You have a Breadcrumbs menu into Website Settings to manage your breadcrumbs.

Only published crumbs are visible in the website. You can also change the name.

You can set it in the Breadcrumbs menu.

Generated breadcrumbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All models included for breadcrumbs are:

#. Product Templates
#. Product Tags
#. Ecommerce Categories
#. Website Pages
    Moreover, this module adds parent_id field to website.page model. This allows to add parent page for static pages.
#. Views
#. Blogs
#. Blog Posts

#. Main object
    When there is nothing at all previous. Generate a breadcrumbs by main_object.

    like 'home / %s / %s' % (main_object._description, main_object.name).
    Otherwise 'home / %s' % main_object.name.
