How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Breadcrumbs generator is available to call in any template:

::

    <t t-call="breadcrumbs_base.breadcrumbs_bar"/>

Foreach template that contain it, then a breadcrumb will be created and activate by default.

    **Warning!**

    If you call it from any portal templates you have to install **'breadcrumbs_base_tmp'** module and
    disable **'Disable My Account Breadcrumbs Bar'** view on web editor.
    Otherwise you will have two breadcrumbs at the same time, this and portal default breadcrumbs.

Settings
~~~~~~~~

You have a Breadcrumbs menu into Website Settings to manage your breadcrumbs.

You can set it in the Breadcrumbs menu.


Generated breadcrumbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All models included for breadcrumbs are:

#. Product Templates
#. Product Tags
#. Ecommerce Categories
#. Website Pages
    Moreover, this module adds parent_id field to website.page model. This allows to add parent page for static pages.
#. Views
#. Blogs
#. Blog Post

#. Main object
    When there is nothing at all previous. Generate a breadcrumbs by main_object.
    If main_object have _description filed then is used
