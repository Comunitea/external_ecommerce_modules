Same Text) and Duplicate Content. That is to say, multiple URLs that leads to the same
page search engine's index.

Because of this is includes website_canonical_url module dependency.

* Configuration

    #. "Settings / Technical / System Parameters / web.base.url"

    #. You can force the domain by setting "Canonical domain" field into website settings.
